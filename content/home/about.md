# Biography

Mark Jones (t-student) is a biostatistician in the Clinical Research Design and Statistics Support Unit at the Hunter Medical Research Institute assisting researchers and commercial clients collect, process, analyse and interpret data from a wide range of studies. Mark is involved in a range of projects from randomized controlled trials to observational studies 
to data visualisation.

Mark interests span statistical methods applied across the medicine, health, environmental and financial domains - anything you can poke a stick at really. 

Mark works predominantly in R and has been doing so for several years now, but will 
pick up Stata and SAS on an intermittent basis as the need arises. 

The main aim of this site is as a teaching aid primarily directed at myself. If the material is of use to someone else then top banana!
